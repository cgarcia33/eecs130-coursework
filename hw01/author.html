        The Brothers Grimm (die Brüder Grimm or die Gebrüder Grimm), Jacob Ludwig Karl and Wilhelm Carl, were German
        academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together collected and published
        folklore during the 19th century. They were among the first and best-known collectors of folk tales, and
        popularized many traditional oral tale types.

        The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood in
        the nearby town of Steinau. Their father's death in 1796 impoverished the family and affected the brothers for
        many years after. They attended the University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to researching
        the early history of German language and literature, including German folktales. The rise of Romanticism during
        the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues
        represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for
        collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between the first edition of
        1812-15, and the seventh and final edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it grew
        from 156 stories to more than 200. In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled
        German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in
        1838 they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches Wörterbuch), which, in their
        lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word Frucht, 'fruit'. (Source:
