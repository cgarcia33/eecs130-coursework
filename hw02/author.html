    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <section>
        <p>
            The Brothers Grimm (die Brüder Grimm or die Gebrüder Grimm), Jacob Ludwig Karl and Wilhelm Carl, were German
            academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together collected and
            published
            folklore during the 19th century. They were among the first and best-known collectors of folk tales, and
            popularized many traditional oral tale types. The brothers were born in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel
            (now Germany) and spent most of their childhood
            in
            the nearby town of Steinau.

            Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm was born on 4 January 1785, and his brother Wilhelm Carl
            Grimm was born on 24 February 1786. Both were born in Hanau, in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel within the
            Holy Roman Empire (present-day Germany), to Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, a jurist, and Dorothea Grimm née Zimmer,
            daughter of a Kassel city councilman.Their father's death in 1796 impoverished the family and affected the
            brothers
            for
            many years after. They attended the University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to
            researching
            the early history of German language and literature, including German folktales. The rise of Romanticism
            during
            the 18th century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Grimms and their colleagues
            represented a pure form of national literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology for
            collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between the first edition
            of
            1812-15, and the seventh and final edition of 1857, they revised their collection many times, so that it
            grew
            from 156 stories to more than 200. In addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled
            German legends. Individually, they published a large body of linguistic and literary scholarship. Together,
            in
            1838 they began work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches Wörterbuch), which, in their
            lifetimes, they completed only as far as the word Frucht, 'fruit'. (Source:

            Many of Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The tales are available in more than 100
            languages and have been adapted by filmmakers including Lotte Reiniger and Walt Disney, with films such as
            Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Sleeping Beauty. During the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as
            propaganda by the Third Reich; later in the 20th century psychologists such as Bruno Bettelheim reaffirmed
            the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales, which
            the Grimms eventually sanitized.
