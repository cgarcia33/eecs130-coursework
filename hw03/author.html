            The Brothers Grimm (die Brüder Grimm or die Gebrüder Grimm), Jacob
            Ludwig Karl and Wilhelm Carl, were German academics, philologists,
            cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together
            collected and published folklore during the 19th century. They were
            among the first and best-known collectors of folk tales, and
            popularized many traditional oral tale types. The brothers were born
            in the town of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel (now Germany) and spent most of
            their childhood in the nearby town of Steinau.

            Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm was born on 4 January 1785, and his brother
            Wilhelm Carl Grimm was born on 24 February 1786. Both were born in
            Hanau, in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel within the Holy Roman
            Empire (present-day Germany), to Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, a jurist,
            and Dorothea Grimm née Zimmer, daughter of a Kassel city
            councilman.Their father's death in 1796 impoverished the family and
            affected the brothers for many years after. They attended the
            University of Marburg where they began a lifelong dedication to
            researching the early history of German language and literature,
            including German folktales. The rise of Romanticism during the 18th
            century had revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to
            the Grimms and their colleagues represented a pure form of national
            literature and culture. The Brothers Grimm established a methodology
            for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for
            folklore studies. Between the first edition of 1812-15, and the
            seventh and final edition of 1857, they revised their collection
            many times, so that it grew from 156 stories to more than 200. In
            addition to collecting and editing folk tales, the brothers compiled
            German legends. Individually, they published a large body of
            linguistic and literary scholarship. Together, in 1838 they began
            work on a massive historical German dictionary (Deutsches
            Wörterbuch), which, in their lifetimes, they completed only as far
            as the word Frucht, 'fruit'. (Source:

            Many of Grimms' folk tales have enjoyed enduring popularity. The
            tales are available in more than 100 languages and have been adapted
            by filmmakers including Lotte Reiniger and Walt Disney, with films
            such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Sleeping Beauty. During
            the 1930s and 40s, the tales were used as propaganda by the Third
            Reich; later in the 20th century psychologists such as Bruno
            Bettelheim reaffirmed the value of the work, in spite of the cruelty
            and violence in original versions of some of the tales, which the
            Grimms eventually sanitized.
